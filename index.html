In addition to serving as a central point for training, resources, and implementation of policy within each branch of the armed services, SAPRO tracks reports of sexual assault in each year and releases results from a biannual survey that includes a measure to estimate how many service members experienced sexual assault in a given year. </p>

            <p>Human Rights Watch published a report in which it found many victims of sexual assault faced fear of retaliation given that "military service members who reported retaliation were 12 times more likely to suffer retaliation for doing so than to see their offender, if a service member, convicted for a sex offense." The report warned that any gains in reporting would be lost if victims who report their assaults continued to experience retaliation. Sadly, this seems to be the exact pattern that played out over the following 5-6 years, with reporting rates falling gradually after 2016 to 30% in 2018 and more drastically to 20% in 2021</p>
